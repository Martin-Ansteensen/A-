# AStar
A program visualizing the A* pathfiniding algorithm

# Setup

# Use
You can either:
* Run A_Star_Pathfinding.exe in build/exe.win32-3.8
* Run A_Star_Pathfinding.py in the main folder (you will then have to install necessary dependencies)

When the progtam is running, a grid of boxes will appear. The program is controlled by using the mouse/touchpad and the keyboard. Here are the commands for opearting the program:

* Use the keys e and s to mark start and end node
* Use r to reset the grid
* Use c to clear the work of the algorithm, and keep the obstacles you have drawn
* Use space to start the algorithm
* Use right mouse button to draw obstacles
* Use left mouse button to remove obstacles
* Use arrow up to increase the delay between each step in the algorithm, and arrow down to decrease (resulting in a faster/slower visualization)
